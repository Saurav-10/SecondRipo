# Simple Airline Ticket Reservation
The proposed Airline Reservation System lets a user book any number of tickets between a selected number of Indian airports. User is given the privilege to choose the 
source airport, destination airport, number of passengers and the type of trip. The type could be either a one-way trip or a round-trip. In case of a one-way trip, the user
is asked to specify only the departure date while in case of round-trip, the user is supposed to enter both the departure date and the return date. Upon give these required 
informationâ€™s, the user can enter the passengers name and proceed to print the tickets.
